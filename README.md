## Production-readyness

This bot currently is missing some polishing especially on stability and usability.
Also it doesnt work with rejoining currently or changing streams.
Therefor I do recommend it should not be used in production just yet.

## Installation

Due to changes to the nio dependency I currently cant upload it to pypi.
For now you have to install it from git directly:

```console
pip install git+https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder.git
```
